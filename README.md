# ARM Reverse Engineering Exercises
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/rustc-serialize.svg)]()
## Overview
These exercises are meant to help identify and understand different patterns in ARM assembly.  All of the examples have been written in Xcode and compiled with clang.  As I create more exercises, I will use different compilers in order to demonstrate different nuances.  The disassembly output will mostly likely be from Hopper, unless stated otherwise.
